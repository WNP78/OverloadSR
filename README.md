This is the source code for the [mod](https://www.simplerockets.com/Mods/View/31529/Overload).
It is "messy", and there is a lot of things in here that aren't used any more, and are relics of a time past when hacky solutions were the only ones. This was also built on a much older version of SR2 than currently, so the methods I use may not be reccommended or efficient. 

#### Open-sourcing wasn't on my mind when I made this, so apologies

tl;dr - here be dragons
