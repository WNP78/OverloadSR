  _description: 'Allows the editing of a part''s raw XML attributes from the designer,
    instead of editing the craft''s XML save file in the game''s files. To get started,
    enable the mod and then select a part and open the part properties window, and
    there should be an extra "Edit XML" button at the top of the part properties
    window. For some more information on how some of the properties you can edit
    work, you can look here:

    https://wnp78.github.io/Sr2Xml/

    The descriptions
    are not complete, so if anyone would like to help out by filling in info, that
    would be welcomed, but make sure to read on the page how to add descriptions,
    rather than editing the generated files directly.'
